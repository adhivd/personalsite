                How my summer filled with paint dance and skits culminated into a meaningful final night.

            <p>It was the day before Junior Homecoming, and we were very much behind on our decorations (two planter boxes sat empty). Concerned that we were drastically understaffed, I contacted people through every method I could think of. Calls. Texts. Chats. Email lists. Hogwarts owls. I did everything I could, telling people that this was their last chance to get involved. As I approached my house at the end of a long school day, I expected to see the same, small group of people to be waiting outside, and mentally prepared for our final all-nighter. As we rolled up into the driveway, I was shocked to see a hundred people hanging out in my front yard!
                <br> <br>
                                                          
I hustled through the crowd and stood up on our old, deadbeat garage couch. A hush swept through as faces lit up to meet my gaze. The group before me was diverse: dancers, writers, programmers, introverts, extroverts, all of whom had come together in a communal effort of school spirit. I felt a special pride in knowing that they, despite all of the stress of Junior year, felt the same collective energy and sense of community that made me fall in love with the idea of school spirit in the first place.
                <br>
 <br>
Amongst the madness, we assigned groups, delegated projects, and the enjoyed a night full of conversation and collaboration. I got to know people I had probably seen hundreds of times but never spoke. Watching sparks of friendship ignite all around me, I realized that despite our different schedules and interests, we were capable of coming together as a community and achieving something together that would have otherwise been impossible. After the night of bonding, we had finished all our budgeted projects, including 20-foot long models of the Golden Gate and Brooklyn Bridges, which we carried through the hallways of Lynbrook with heads held high.
                <br><br>
 
It’s easy for some to dismiss school spirit as frivolous, but that misses the whole point. A shared school spirit within the community gives me something to look forward to – something to smile about on a day-to-day basis. Though the experience only lasted one night, I will never forget our 3 A.M. struggle to roll our fully functional, 10-foot-tall ferris wheel down the street and through the gates of Lynbrook. School spirit isn’t just another quality or characteristic; for me, school spirit is a lifestyle. That memory encapsulates that idea for me, which is why it’s so integral to my high school experience.
