                <h1>Lyrics</h1>
                <h2>Where is the Love - Black Eyed Peas</h2>
                <p>What's wrong with the world, mama
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Now, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all            <br><br>
                    
                    This song touches me because in a world where we tend to resort to disagreement and chaos, it reminds us that nothing transcends the power and peace behind love. Whenever I'm feeling in a bad mood I crank this song up, not only for the great and chill vibe/tun, but to remind me of the more important things in life.

                <h2>Frankenstein</h2>
                <p>When I looked at all the books we would be reading senior year for Euro Lit, never did I imagine that Frankenstein would be my favorite novel of the year. I think what truly connected me to the novel / understand it's real life implications/lessons was the research project we did around it. It allowed me to delve into Artificial Intelligence (which I've always loved reading about) and truly understand how it worked + how it could be similar of a predicament to Frankenstein, where technology made simply to make "advanced tech" could potentially turn against us. This was honestly such an intereseting unit, and I thank you for giving us the opportunity to research it :) </p>
