            <p>Dear Future son/daughter,
The most important thing for you to understand is that this is your time to explore. Knowing that by your era, college admissions + this whole process will probably either be through the roof in competitiveness or fundamentally changed, it shouldn’t matter anyways. Do things that genuinely interest you. Explore new opportunities. Join niche clubs. Meet people who are really unique and get to know them. Learn about their lives. If I could do high school over again, I would just spend more of my freshman year discovering all of the possible paths I could take. You have a lot of free time in the early years, and it’s important that you spend it carving out cool experiences. <br><br>
Next, take big risks. Nobody has ever gotten extremely far in life without falling down and making mistakes over and over again. Go ambitious, learn from your failures, and repeat until something really great happens. I believed that high school was supposed to be a safe time, when in reality you can do so many things with your time. Obviously, however, your time is limited. So I would adjust this piece of advice and say take big, calculated, risks. Understand and thoroughly research before you delve into things. Try out for a varsity sport. Go big for test results. Never put half of your heart in anything. If you’re going to spend quality time on something, then make sure what you’re putting into it is really quality. Your time is precious, and you want to take risks and leaps on ideas that’ll have big returns + learning curves. <br><br>
Finally, be kind. I can’t emphasize this enough. Like I mentioned earlier about small smiles helping me on my lows, your kindness has the opportunity to attract people who are going to reciprocate that happiness. If you can connect with people on that fundamental level of empathy and understanding, you’re going to find yourself a lot more comfortable throughout your high school experience. It may take time, you may not make friends immediately, you may be having a bad high school experience - but if you uphold the virtues of being a humble and grateful person, people will notice and accept you. If you can get through these four years only accomplishing this, that itself would make me incredibly proud. You can only grow and prosper that gracious and happy attitude from there, and it’ll only help fight the stressful and lonely days.
From, Your father (Adhiv)
