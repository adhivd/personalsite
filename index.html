                Hey! I’m a high school senior at Lynbrook High who loves to intersect technology and design, serve in student government, and dance for no reason.
                <br><br>
        Below you can find various projects I’ve been involved with. If you’d like to talk, shoot me an email. Cheers!              </p>

            <p>Being in student council, I would always be frustrated with how slow our meetings would move. Action was an idea I came up with and worked on with my two friends to help make meeting action items and follow ups within Google Docs more efficient.
After pivoting and iterating over and over again, we finally ended up launching our Chrome Extension on Product Hunt, in which we got 158 upvotes and >1.5 visitors to the page. We wrote a medium post afterwards reflecting on the mistakes we made.</p>
