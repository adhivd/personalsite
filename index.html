                Hey! I’m a high school senior at Lynbrook High who loves to intersect technology and design, serve in student government, and dance for no reason.
                <br><br>
        Below you can find various projects I’ve been involved with. If you’d like to talk, shoot me an email. Cheers!              </p>

            <p>The past few years I’ve invested myself into my school’s student government, where I’ve lead our Homecoming process twice, planned out 8 pep rallies, revised the ASB Constitution, created a website for our school’s ASB, planned a gratitude card project with over 2,600 thank you cards sent by students, organized over 70+ clubs on campus, and planned a Junior Prom (with 200+ attendees, $11k in revenue, and $3k in profit).
                
            <br><br>
                
            I currently serve as ASB Vice President (entire student body). In prior years, I've served as Class President, Class Treasurer, and a Legislative Council Representative.

            <br>
            
            <p>This past summer (2016), I attended MIT Launch, a 4-week high school business incubator focused on teaching young entrepreneurs the essentials of launching startups. It took place on MIT's campus at Next Door.
                <br><br>
            Through the program, we walked through countless case studies, talks from MIT/Harvard Professors and students, and startup simulations. We conducted market research interviews in MIT cafeterias and "ideated" in the dorm hallways. Extensive resources were provided to us, including access to founder meetups, the MIT Trust Center for Entrepreneurship, and a ProtoWorks 3D Printing Lab.
 <br><br>
I worked on an iOS application called SelfCheck, which allows users to conduct self-examinations and track any irregularities on their bodies.</p>

            <p>My friends and I co-founded Develop Academy, a programming and leadership camp for middle school students. I played a role as both a camp coordinator and instructor, planning out logistics and teaching website development and a speech workshop for the kids.
            <br><br>
            The camp spanned two weeks, containing two sessions and 24 energetic middle schoolers. By the end of the program, we received an average satisfaction rating of 4.8/5 from students and parents.</p>

            <p>After getting it passed in October 2014, three friends and I began to teach beginner and advanced website development as a club on Lynbrook campus. We started off slow our first year, though this year have a consistent membership base of over 50 people.
                <br><br>
We developed our own curriculum (constantly changing + improving) and each cover skills that span across multiple facets of website development, giving our members an enriched learning experience. This year I'm serving as Vice President.</p>

            <br>
            
            <p>All coming from a competitive, fast paced pubic school, last year a few friends and I decided to set out to try and combat the one dimensional view of success that grades and numbers define everything about you. In order to do that, we brought in 5 speakers all with different backgrounds but one common theme: to introduce a new angle on life (hence the name, Angles: acute intersections of interesting perspectives).
                <br><br>
We got over 200+ attendees to sign up and attend the event, in which we also held a Q/A afterwards with questions voted on by the attendees in between speeches and during breaks. Our school’s PTSA loved the idea, and gave us a grant to fund all expenses of renting the facility and getting presents for the speakers + goodie bags for the attendees.</p>

            <p>Being in student council, I would always be frustrated with how slow our meetings would move. Action is an idea I worked on with my two friends to help make meeting action items and follow ups within Google Docs more efficient.
After pivoting and iterating over and over again, we finally ended up launching our Chrome Extension on Product Hunt, in which we got 158 upvotes and >1.5k visitors to the page. We wrote a medium post afterwards reflecting on the mistakes we made.</p>

        Self Check is an iOS application which focuses on allowing users to remind themselves to conduct self examinations + track any irregularities they find on their body. In the future we plan on expanding with a feature to connect with local dermatologists and replace full on appointments with a cheaper fee of sending in photos.
                <br><br>
        We’ve been in contact with doctors from Harvard Medical School and dermatologists running their own clinics, all of which are excited about tele-dermatology rising in the industry and ready to help beta test our app. Incubated in 4 weeks at MIT Launch.</p>

            <p>The project that started it all for me. In 6th grade, I got together with my friends Matthew and Will to solve one of our largest headaches as 11 year olds: <i>knowing who would be in our classes the upcoming year.</i>
                <br><br>
We built a drop dead simple web app that displayed your classes and who would be in them. After 5 years of design revisions and pushes every summer, we’ve amassed over 1000 users from 5 different schools in our area.</p>

            <p>An application me and my two friends built to make student council elections fair and equitable, allowing candidates to put up their platform, a picture, and links relevant to their campaigns— where the number of friends you have doesn’t define how much outreach you can get with your campaign.
                
                <br><br>
We’ve been running it for 3 years, this year amassing 23,000+ page views from 1500 users. We also introduced a Q/A section into each candidate’s profile, which was extremely popular for engaging candidates and understanding their platforms. We’re currently working with our school administration to have our district officially sponsor and use the web app for all school elections.</p>
