                The small daily morning interactions that made  the difference.

            <p>This is less about a single moment, and more about a moment I’ve experienced for the past 8 years of my life. When I was in 5th grade and my brother was entering his freshman year at Lynbrook, my parents used to drop us off to school - my brother first, then me. We get dropped off at the side of Lynbrook, where cars of sleep deprived parents line up every morning and are ushered by a crossing guard. Sounds like a pretty standard scene, but what struck me every morning was that the walking guard would always smile and greet every single student, every single morning. It didn’t matter if it was bright and sunny or cold and rainy, she displayed the kind of smile that spread warmth and encouragement to everyone that walked by. From 5th grade all the way through 8th, and then eventually from 9th grade all the way through 12th, I would see her shine that glowing, contagious smile. It wasn’t too long into high school that I learned her name was Mrs. Knudson, and that she works with the special ed students in our Voyager program. Mrs. Knudson didn’t have to smile at each and every person that crossed her path. But it was an act of kindness that, on some of my most stressful and tired high school days, lifted my spirits just a little bit. Sometimes enough to realize that I lived a pretty good life, and that everything would turn out okay. It also taught me how much a simple smile could help the people around me. You never know what someone’s dealing with; kindness, however unnecessary it may seem, can do amazing things. It was the smallest exchanges with a lady who I’ve never formally introduced with that boosted me up and made my experiences just a little more special.
